# Roadmap — Recipies (Vibe Coding)

This repo follows a lightweight roadmapping approach. High-level epics and short-term tasks are tracked in Issues. Below are current epics and starter tasks (linked to issues).

## Epics

- UX & Visuals
  - #9 Polish visual spacing to match wireframe
  - #6 Make tiles open full HTML detail (progressive enhancement)
  - #5 Keyboard UX: chips navigable and deletion with Backspace
  - #3 Persist UI state (last used ingredients)

- Backend & Data
  - #4 Improve matching algorithm
  - #2 Server-backed suggestion endpoint
  - #5 Add HTML recipe seeding and sample data script
  - #8 Add unit tests for normalize logic

- Infrastructure
  - #10 Add CI: run import & basic lint/tests

## Short-term todo (next 1-2 sprints)

1. Add recipe detail HTML view (#1)
2. Server-backed suggestion endpoint (#2)
3. Keyboard UX improvements (#5)
4. Polish visual spacing (#9)
5. Add CI workflow (#10)

If you'd like, I can:
- Create a GitHub Project board and add these cards (requires additional token scopes), or
- Create a PR that adds `ROADMAP.md` and a starter `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` to the repo (I can do that now).

Which option do you prefer?
